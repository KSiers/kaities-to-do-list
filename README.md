I created a simple To-Do List where one can log into Google Calendar and be able to add, edit, and delete tasks for that day.  

You will need to have a Gmail account, and be able to log into your account to access Google Calendar to add, edit, and delete the items.

The project is hosted on Amazon Web Services, and Google Calendar API was used to assist with the database. 

The API key was included in the notes when submitted.

functions created: updateToDo, updateToDo, deleteToDo
